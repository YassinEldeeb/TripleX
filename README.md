# TripleX
TripleX is a little fun game I made with C++ very while ago when I started programming.
It's basically a game about Math where you're a secret agent breaking into secure server rooms and you've to enter the correct code to continue.

## Given:
1- ${num} numbers in the code

2- The codes multiply to give ${some number}

3- The sum of the codes = ${some number}

and you've to solve these fun math equations and It gets harder and harder after each room you pass.
